# Why Donkeys?

There is a cyberpunk donkey in the header of my website. The design is also rather whimsical compared to what you might be used to seeing nowadays. The reasons for that are two fold:

1. _Donkeys are great!_

   It's become a running gag among my group of friends and collegues that I'm obsessed with donkeys. They frequently show up in my profile pictures, google meets backgrounds and more. I don't exactly know what it is but something about them just resonates with me. I don't _really_ want to own one, but I enjoy looking at them.

   Also, donkeys are fighters. They're frequently used a guard animals to defend other life-stock from predators such as foxes. Unlike horses, donkeys will not flee but go on the offensive. I find that endearing.

   If I was somebody who enjoyed this sort of thing, I would probably muse about how that supposedly is a character trait I have in common with them and how they're some sort of spirit animal or some such - but alas, I don't.

2. _I hail from a time when the web used to be more fun_
